This notebook contains a simple optimization model for a production plan. 
On the production line we are producing multiple products on one machine over multiple periods. 
When producing a certain product on the machine a setup must be performed, which is costly. Futhermore, The production time of the products differ. 
The production plan must meet the demand, which is read from an Excel file. The demand must be met in the same period. Further, there are constraints, which will be explained in the notebook.

Follwing skills are used in the notebook: Prescriptive analytics, mathematival modelling, stochastic optimization, data handling, slicing, visualization

++++ Note that IBM Cplex is necessary to run this notebook ++++
